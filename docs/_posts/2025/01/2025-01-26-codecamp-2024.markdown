This post continues the series of posting summary from our
Codecamp. See my post from [last year]({% post_url 2024/01/2024-01-14-codecamp-2024 %})
to better understand the context.

Another year, another intensive coding session from Thursday to Sunday.
Fun, learning, failing, and succeeding. That's what Codecamp is all about.

This year we continued expanding Jarmo's existing [Unity](https://unity.com) 
functionality and dynamic crafting of the world using voice commands.
