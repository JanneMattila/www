When I saw this in my feed, I knew I had to test it right away:

{% include xEmbed.html id="BicepLang/status/1902432389193961744" %}

I chose `rg-app-services` resource group and exported that:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2025/03/23/export-as-bicep/export.png" %}

No big surprises and it worked as advertised. I'll definitely use this over the ARM template export in the future.

Go ahead and try this yourself!
