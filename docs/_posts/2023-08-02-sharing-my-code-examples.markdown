# Improving sharing of my code examples

I've had multiple different blogs and websites over the years.
Many of them have already disappeared from the internet and not available anymore
even from the internet archives (but I managed to find [one](https://web.archive.org/web/20060114062052/http://www.rattimus.net:80/Programming/filestopdf.html)!).

If you're interested, then you can check some of my old posts from these sites:
- [dev.to/janne_mattila](https://dev.to/janne_mattila/)
- [medium.com/@janne_mattila](https://medium.com/@janne_mattila)
- [docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/jannemattila](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jannemattila/)

I have always wanted to share my experiences to make
someone else's life a bit more easier. 

I haven't been writing articles for a while, but I have been
writing code examples and sharing them in GitHub.
You can find **my 150+ repositories in [GitHub](https://github.com/JanneMattila?tab=repositories)**.

[![My GitHub Repositories](/assets/posts/2023-08-02-sharing-my-code-examples/GitHub.png)](https://github.com/JanneMattila?tab=repositories)

I have been thinking that I should start writing articles again,
just to be able to share some background information behind the code examples.
They don't necessarily need to be long articles, but just something
to give some context for the code examples to make them more
easily understandable.

Stay tuned!
