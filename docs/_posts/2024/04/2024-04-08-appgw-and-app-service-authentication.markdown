I wrote about
[Application Gateway and dynamic custom rules in Web Application Firewall]({% post_url 2024/04/2024-04-01-appgw-and-dynamic-custom-rules %})
in my previous post. 
In this post, I'll continue to build on top of those learnings and connect dots with App Service authentication
from which I also wrote recently
[App Service and OpenID Connect with Salesforce]({% post_url 2024/03/2024-03-25-app-service-and-openid-connect %}).

This time I have the following scenario:

- Two public facing web applications hosted in App Service
  - The first application `AnonymousApp` allows anonymous access
  - The second application `AdminApp` is protected by App Service authentication
    - Entra ID as the identity provider
    - This should be reachable only at `/admin` and any other traffic should go to the first application:
{% include mermaid.html postfix="1" text="
graph TD
    User -->|https://host/...|AppGw
    AppGw -->|https://host/| AnonymousApp
    AppGw -->|https://host/admin| AdminApp
" %}
- `AdminApp` could be limited to private network only, 
  but it was decided to be directly accessible from internet with seperate path and authentication
- Application Gateway is in the front of the App Service
  - Managed rule sets are enabled in the Web Application Firewall
  - Capabilities of Application gateway are used extensively e.g., redirects HTTP to HTTPS:
{% include mermaid.html postfix="2" text="
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant AppGw
    participant App
    User->>AppGw: http://host/
    AppGw->>AppGw: Redirect rule
    AppGw->>User: Redirect to HTTPS
    User->>AppGw: https://host/
    AppGw->>App: Proxy request https://app/
    App->>AppGw: Return content
    AppGw->>User: Return content
" %}
- **Extra bonus**: DNS is handled by separate team, so we have to ask them to do the changes for us pre- and post-deployment
<br/>

Here is the authentication flow for the above scenarios:<br/>

{% include mermaid.html postfix="3" text="

    AppGw->>User: Redirect to Entra ID
    User->>Entra ID: https://login.microsoftonline.com/...
    Note right of Entra ID: Login
    Entra ID->>User: Redirect to<br/>https://host/admin/signin-oidc
    User->>AppGw: https://host/admin/signin-oidc
    AppGw->>AdminApp: Proxy request<br/>https://adminapp/admin/signin-oidc
    Note left of AdminApp: EasyAuth processes authentication
    AdminApp->>AppGw: Return content
    AppGw->>User: Return content
" %}

## Deployment

In order to deploy our applications successfully behind the reverse proxy scenario,
there are a few things we need to understand:

[Preserve the original HTTP host name between a reverse proxy and its back-end web application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/host-name-preservation)

[Configure App Service with Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/configure-web-app)

[App Service and Authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)

[Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain)

[Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

[Application Gateway and Modifications to the request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/how-application-gateway-works#modifications-to-the-request)

From the above _good reading list_, we've learned the following things:

- We need to make sure that our application works behind reverse proxy
  - We need to preserve the original host name in the request to the App Service
    - In practice this means that our App Service should be configured with the same custom domain name as the Application Gateway
  - **Or** then your application should support scenario when it's behind reverse proxy
    - Application should work with `X-Forwarded-*` and/or `X-Original-Host` headers
  - Our application should work when accessed using `/admin` path
- Application Gateway adds `X-Original-Host` header to the backend request, but it does not insert `X-Forwarded-Host` header
  - App Service authentication uses `X-Forwarded-Host` header to determine the redirect URL
  - We need to create a _rewrite rule_ in the Application Gateway to insert `X-Forwarded-Host` header to the backend requests 
    **or** configure the App Service authentication to use `X-Original-Host` header

Here are the high-level steps for our deployment:

1. Create Entra ID App Registration
   - This will be used in the App Service authentication
2. Create pre-deployment DNS records
  - CNAME record for the domain pointing to the App Service
  - TXT record for domain verification done by the App Service
3. Create certificate for App Gateway
4. Deploy Azure infrastructure assets
5. Create post-deployment DNS record
  - A record for the domain pointing to the public IP of the Application Gateway
6. Test the setup

Letâ€™s go through these steps next in more detail.

## 1. Create Entra ID App Registration

I've written about
[Entra ID Group automation with PowerShell]({% post_url 2024/02/2024-02-05-entra-id-group-automation %})
which basically shows how I approach the Entra ID automation.

I'll use the same approach here to create the App Registration for the Entra ID:

```powershell
# Public fully qualified custom domain name
$domain = "myapp.jannemattila.com"

# Create Entra ID app used in authentication
$appPath = "/admin" # In this demo "admin" is the "secured" application
$json = @"
{
  "displayName": "$domain",
  "signInAudience": "AzureADMyOrg",
  "requiredResourceAccess": [
    {
      "resourceAppId": "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
      "resourceAccess": [
        {
          "id": "e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d",
          "type": "Scope"
        }
      ]
    },
  ],
  "web": {
    "implicitGrantSettings": {
      "enableIdTokenIssuance": true
    },
    "redirectUris": [
      "https://$domain$appPath/.auth/login/aad/callback"
    ]
  }
}
"@

$json

$applicationResponse = Invoke-AzRestMethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications" -Method POST -Payload $json
$application = $applicationResponse.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
$application.appId

$secretResponse = Invoke-AzRestMethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$($application.id)/addPassword" -Method POST
$secret = $secretResponse.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$clientId = $application.appId
$clientSecretPlainText = $secret.secretText

$clientSecret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $clientSecretPlainText -Force -AsPlainText
```

After executing the above script, you should have the `clientId` and `clientSecret` variables saved for yourself
and following application deployed to the Entra ID:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/myapp.png" %}

We're going to use these values in our deployment later.

## 2. Create pre-deployment DNS records

In our setup we have to now create the following DNS records:

1. CNAME record for the domain pointing to the App Service
2. TXT record for domain verification done by the App Service

We cannot yet create A record because we don't have the public IP of the Application Gateway available.
That needs to be post deployment step.

CNAME record we can create pre-deployment, because we set the domain name of the App Service in our deployment.
App Service domain verification is something that we cannot set ourselves, but we can get the verification id
using following script:

```powershell
# Get custom domain verification id
$params = @{
  ResourceProviderName = "Microsoft.App"
  ResourceType = "getCustomDomainVerificationId"
  ApiVersion = "2023-08-01-preview"
  Method = "POST"
}
$customDomainVerificationId = (Invoke-AzRestMethod @params).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
# Note: This is unique _per_ subscription!
$customDomainVerificationId

# Create TXT record "asuid.myapp" to your DNS zone -> $customDomainVerificationId
# Create CNAME record in your DNS zone -> $domain -> <yourappservice>.azurewebsites.net
# After deployment, create A record in your DNS zone -> $domain -> <public IP of AppGw>
```

**Important note:** Custom domain verification id is unique per subscription.

Now we're ready to create the CNAME record for the domain pointing to the App Service:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="90%" height="90%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/cname.png" %}

Similarly, we can create the TXT record for the domain verification
identifier we got from the previous script:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="90%" height="90%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/txt.png" %}

Next, we can create certificate for the App Gateway.

## 3. Create certificate for App Gateway

In this demo, I'm going to use a self-signed certificate for the App Gateway but in real world scenario
you would use a certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

Here is the script to create the self-signed certificate for our domain (run script as administrator):

```powershell
# Public fully qualified custom domain name
$domain = "myapp.jannemattila.com"

# Certificate password
$certificatePasswordPlainText = "<your certificate password>"
$certificatePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $certificatePasswordPlainText -Force -AsPlainText

$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname $domain

Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath cert.pfx -Password $certificatePassword
```

After executing the above script, you should have the `cert.pfx` file available for yourself.
We'll place it next to our deployment files.

Now we're ready to deploy the Azure infrastructure assets.

## 4. Deploy Azure infrastructure assets

In our previous steps we've created assets that we now need to pass to our deployment script:

```powershell
$result = .\deploy.ps1 `
  -CertificatePassword $certificatePassword `
  -ClientId $clientId `
  -ClientSecret $clientSecret `
  -CustomDomain $domain

# Add this to A record into your DNS zone
$result.Outputs.ip.value
```

After the deployment script has finished, we have the public IP of the Application Gateway available.
We're going to use it in next step.

Our deployment is using
[App Service managed certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate?tabs=apex#create-a-free-managed-certificate)
which requires a bit more complex Bicep code.
There is good background for this topic in the Bicep repository discussions:

{% include githubEmbed.html text="Azure/bicep/discussions/5006" link="Azure/bicep/discussions/5006" %}

In our scenario, we've _on purpose_ different implementations for reverse proxy handling for our two web apps:
- `AnonymousApp` is handing information from HTTP headers and has C# code implemented to handle reverse proxy scenario
  - You can use this approach **if you can change the code**
- `AdminApp` is running in app service which uses same custom domain
  - This is a recommended option but also **only** option if you cannot change the code of the application

This approach is also recommended in the Application Gateway backend pool settings:
{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/backend.png" %}

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/host-name-preservation).
Here is also step-by-step article how to 
[Configure App Service with Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/configure-web-app).

Here are the deployed resources:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/resources.png" %}

## 5. Create post-deployment DNS record

Before we can add A record to our DNS Zone, we have to remove the previous CNAME record.
After that we're ready to create the A record with the public IP of the Application Gateway:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="90%" height="90%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/a.png" %}

Now we're ready to test the setup.

## 6. Test the setup

First, we need to test HTTP to HTTPS redirection in Application Gateway:

```powershell
# Will redirect to HTTPS
curl "http://$domain" --verbose
curl "http://$domain/admin/" --verbose
```

Both should redirect the traffic to HTTPS.

If you have been testing with CNAMEd domain, 
you might need to flush the DNS resolver cache before A record gets updated to your machine:

```powershell
ipconfig /flushdns
```

Second, we need to test the anonymous access:

```powershell
# Will return anonymous page content
curl "https://$domain" --verbose --insecure
curl "https://$domain/any/path/here" --verbose --insecure
```

We're using `--insecure` in the above commands because we're using self-signed certificate.
If you open the URL in the browser, you'll see the certificate error:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/certerror.png" %}

You have to use **Advanced > Continue to the website** to proceed.

And lastly, we start to test the App Service authentication:

```powershell
# Forces authentication
curl "https://$domain/admin" --verbose --insecure
```

You should get `401 Unauthorized` with redirect to the Entra ID login.

When you _try to run the login process in your browser_, you might end up with this error page,
so our setup is not yet fully working as expected:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/autherror.png" %}

But if you try to use browser developer tools and analyze the flow, everything looks good from that perspective.

Let's analyze our Application Gateway firewall logs:

```sql
AGWFirewallLogs
| where Action == "Blocked"
```

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/firewalllogs1.png" %}

There is a single `Blocked` request in the logs. Let's analyze it further:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/firewalllogs2.png" %}
{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/firewalllogs3.png" %}

We can quickly see that our Web Application Firewall is blocking the request.
See more details about [managed rulesets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules).

The rule `949110` is actually _special_ rule since it blocks if the
[anomaly scoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules?tabs=drs21#anomaly-scoring)
is too high.
If you look carefully the above logs, then you notice following text there:

> **Inbound Anomaly Score Exceeded (Total Score: 6)**

We need to analyze the logs to see what is causing the high anomaly score.

Let's continue our digging by executing the following query:

```sql
AGWFirewallLogs
| where RequestUri == "/admin/.auth/login/aad/callback"
```

Now we have three records instead of one:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/firewalllogs4.png" %}

Looking at the details shows that there are two other rules that are causing the high anomaly score:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/firewalllogs5.png" %}

So, the interesting rules are actually:

- [920230 - Multiple URL Encoding Detected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules?tabs=drs21#anomaly-scoring:~:text=Abuse%20Attack%20Attempt-,920230,-Multiple%20URL%20Encoding)
- [942430 - Restricted SQL Character Anomaly Detection (args): # of special characters exceeded (12)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules?tabs=drs21#anomaly-scoring:~:text=SQL%20Injection%20Attack-,942430,-Restricted%20SQL%20Character)

We have to now fix these [false positives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/web-application-firewall-troubleshoot#fixing-false-positives).

In this implementation, we're going to create exclusions for rules:

- `920230`
- `942430`

**but** only for URL `/admin/.auth/login/aad/callback`:

```powershell
exclusions: [
  {
    matchVariable: 'RequestArgKeys'
    selector: '/admin/.auth/login/aad/callback'
    selectorMatchOperator: 'EndsWith'
    exclusionManagedRuleSets: [
      {
        ruleSetType: 'Microsoft_DefaultRuleSet'
        ruleSetVersion: '2.1'

        ruleGroups: [
          {
            ruleGroupName: 'PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT'
            rules: [
              {
                ruleId: '920230'
              }
            ]
          }
          {
            ruleGroupName: 'SQLI'
            rules: [
              {
                ruleId: '942440'
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
}
```

When that is done, we can test the setup again, and you should see EasyAuth headers available for your application:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/admin.png" %}

## Troubleshooting tips

In your implementation, you might stumble into some issues. Here are a few tips to help you to troubleshoot:

### App Service authentication issues

If you're having issues with App Service authentication, you might want to start by analyzing with browser developer tools
and pay special attention to the `redirect_uri`:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/redirect.png" %}

It should have path `/admin/.auth/login/aad/callback`:

```text
https://login.microsoftonline.com
  /<tenantid>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
    ?response_type=code+id_token
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.jannemattila.com%2Fadmin%2F.auth%2Flogin%2Faad%2Fcallback
    &client_id=<clientid>
    &scope=openid+profile+email
    &response_mode=form_post
    &nonce=27d043a907e540e794c7cb36b6128557_20240401092200
    &state=redir%3D%252Fadmin%252F
```

If it fails to some other issues after the redirect from Entra ID to your app, then check app service
_Diagnose and solve problems_ and then _Investigate EasyAuth errors_:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/easyauth.png" %}

### Reverse proxy issues:

You try to handle reverse proxy scenario in your application the code, but it still
leaks the original host name out:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/name1.png" %}

Check your application code and make sure that you understand which headers it is using.
If you're using ASP.NET Core, then you might want to check the following documentation:

[Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

From that documentation you can see that it's relying on `X-Forwarded-Host` header.
**However**, that header is not inserted by the Application Gateway by default.

You can either change your code to use `X-Original-Host` header or you can create a rewrite rule in the Application Gateway.

Here is how you can change your ASP.NET Core application to use `X-Original-Host` header:

```csharp
// Abbreviated code
var options = new ForwardedHeadersOptions
{
  ForwardedHeaders =
    ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedHost |
    ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor |
    ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto
};

options.ForwardedHostHeaderName = "X-Original-Host";

app.UseForwardedHeaders(options);
```

If you want to use `X-Forwarded-Host` header, then you can create a rewrite rule in the Application Gateway:

```powershell
rewriteRuleSets: [
  {
    name: 'rewriteRule1'
    properties: {
      rewriteRules: [
        {
          ruleSequence: 100
          name: 'add-forwarded-host-header'
          actionSet: {
            requestHeaderConfigurations: [
              {
                headerName: 'X-Forwarded-Host'
                headerValue: '{var_host}'
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

After you've added the rewrite rule, you should see the `X-Forwarded-Host` header in your application:

```
X-Forwarded-Host: myapp.jannemattila.com
X-ORIGINAL-HOST: myapp.jannemattila.com
```

**Important note**: ASP.NET _eats_ `X-Forwarded-Host` header if it's using it so you might not see
that anymore if you print headers in your application.

---

Next category of issues are related to path handling in the reverse proxy scenario.
You might get the following output when accessing `/admin` path:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/path1.png" %}

Application code actually resorted to the 404 handler since it didn't find content for that page.
This might happen if you expected following automatic  mapping of the path:

```text
https://myapp.jannemattila.com/admin -> https://adminapp.azurewebsites.net/
```

Options to overcome this issue:

**Option 1: Merge these two apps to one**

On purpose I've separated these two apps to show how you can handle different scenarios.
But if you don't need to have separate apps, then you don't have to handle the path at all.
_Sometimes_ this is a valid option.

**Option 2: Handle the path in your application code**

This is framework specific but in ASP.NET Core you can use `UsePathBase`:

```csharp
// Abbreviated code
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UsePathBase(new PathString("/admin"));
}
```

And for your static assets you might need to do certain tricks as well e.g., 
JavaScript assets with fixed paths. Here are some options to think and test:

[The Document Base URL element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base):

```html
<base href="/admin/">
```

In `cshtml` files you can use `Url.Content` to get the root path:

```html
<script>
    var WebApp = WebApp || {};
    WebApp.Root = "@Url.Content("~/")";

    console.log(`WebApp.Root: ${WebApp.Root}`);
</script>
```

That can be used to build other paths in your application e.g., SignalR hub connection in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Abbreviated code
let hubRoute = `${WebApp.Root}Echo`;
let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl(hubRoute)
    .withAutomaticReconnect()
    .withHubProtocol(protocol)
    .build();
```

After implementing these changes, your application should work correctly from `/admin` path:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/path3.png" %}

**Option 3: Rewrite rule in Application Gateway**

You can use Application Gateway to rewrite the path before it's sent to the backend app.
See more details from the documentation:
[Rewrite HTTP headers and URL with Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/rewrite-http-headers-url).

Here is how you can rewrite the path in the Application Gateway:

```powershell
{
  ruleSequence: 200
  name: 'admin-path'
  conditions: [
    {
      variable: 'var_uri_path'
      pattern: '.*admin/(.*)'
      ignoreCase: true
    }
  ]
  actionSet: {
    urlConfiguration: {
      modifiedPath: '{var_uri_path_1}'
      reroute: false
    }
  }
}
```

Now backend app is receiving the request without the `/admin` path:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/path2.png" %}

But you can easily leak out the original path in the response and they might be hard to rewrite in the Application Gateway:

{% include imageEmbed.html width="100%" height="100%" link="/assets/posts/2024/04/08/appgw-and-app-service-authentication/path4.png" %}

**Option 4: Virtual applications and directories in App Service**

_Okay this is not really an option_ but _technically_
you can use virtual applications and directories in App Service.
Of course, this option is only available on Windows and
if deploy your code directly to the App Service (so it is not technically possible if using Linux or containers).
