We have a habit of starting a new year with a Codecamp
with my friend [Jarmo Hämäläinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmo-h%C3%A4m%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen-821337a/).
This year was no exception. Intensive coding from Thursday to Sunday.
We used over 50 hours per person making it a total of over 100 hours of coding
in just a few days.

As always, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new things.
During the Codecamp you also always have struggles and problems
but that's part of the learning process.
It is sometimes hard to explain all the things we did but let me try.

This year we expanded Jarmo's existing [Unity](https://unity.com) examples 
with different AI capabilities from [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/) portfolio. 
You can find more existing videos
from [Jarmo's LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmo-h%C3%A4m%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen-821337a/recent-activity/all/).

Our _Avatar City_ is a virtual world where you can walk around
and talk with different AI enhanced avatars.
Avatars themselves are also walking around freely in the world.
You experience it with VR headset and hand controllers to make it more immersive.

Experience is **not scripted** or **pre-recorded**, 
so you can talk with them about anything you want.

We're using Finnish language because _finally_ AI has reached the level
that we don't have to rely on English language anymore.

Our world has a lot of different characters, but let me introduce a few of them to you:

_Noora_ is an artist. She sells her art.

_Selma_ sells various antique items. She tells you about the items and their history.

_Harri_ is a busy business guy, and he is pretty grumpy.

_Talyn_ is from Mars, and he is quite an interesting character!

Technically our solution can be illustrated with the following diagrams from _client_ and _server_ perspectives.

Here is client-side flow:

{% include mermaid.html text="
flowchart TD
    A[Client] --> |Walk in the world<br/>Find Avatar you want to talk with<br/>Start talking| B(Avatar)
    B --> |Speech audio is collected<br/><br/>After pause in speaking| C(Audio clip)
    C --> |Send audio to server| D(\"Server<br/>(see below flow)\")
    D --> |Server responds| E{Contains<br/>image?}
    E --> |No| G(Play response audio)
    E --> |Yes| F(Show image)
    F --> G
    G --> |Continue| B
" %}

Here is server-side flow:

{% include mermaid.html text="
flowchart TD
    A[Server receives request] --> |Use avatars parameters| B(Convert speech to text)
    B --> C{Image<br/>required?}
    C -->|Yes| D(Generate image)
    C --> |No|E(Generate response text)
    D --> E
    E --> F(Convert text to speech)
    F --> End(Return response to client)
" %}

Here are a few images and links to videos:

Talking with _Noora_:

Videos have been recorded from VR headset and you can see them from [Jarmo's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Jarmo_Hamalainen). 
Here's the summary video:

You can follow him in the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmo-h%C3%A4m%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen-821337a/)
to get notified when he posts new videos.

We had a lot of fun at our Codecamp.
