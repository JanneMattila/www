[Azure Arc Jumpstart](https://azurearcjumpstart.io) is a great resource if you need to learn or test out various Arc scenarios. 
Recently I had to test out few things with [Azure Stack HCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/overview)
and Azure Arc Jumpstart came to the rescue with its [Jumpstart HCIBox](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_jumpstart_hcibox/). 
Just follow those instructions as you're good to go.

Since I like to deploy my environment using scripts, 
I've created a little PowerShell helper for deploying my HCI environment. 
You can find it here:

**Here are the step-by-step instructions on how you can test it too.**
