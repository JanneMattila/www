Just two weeks ago I wrote about 
[Advent of Code 2023]({% post_url 2023/11/2023-11-27-advent-of-code %})
and mentioned that I don't typically do visualizations.

But day 10 was so fun puzzle that I had to do it!

First, here is the start state of the puzzle:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2023/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10/aoc-2023-day10-1.png" %}

Here is the state after doing the full loop around the pipes:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2023/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10/aoc-2023-day10-2.png" %}

Here I have marked red all the possible tiles that _might_ be enclosed by the loop:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2023/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10/aoc-2023-day10-3.png" %}

Here I have "zoomed" in to double the resolution:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2023/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10/aoc-2023-day10-4.png" %}

And finally, here are the tiles that are enclosed by the loop:

{% include imageEmbed.html link="/assets/posts/2023/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10/aoc-2023-day10-5.png" %}

Let's see if I'll do any more visualizations in the future.
