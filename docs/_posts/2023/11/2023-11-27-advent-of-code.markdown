[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 is starting in just a few days.
25 coding puzzles to solve in December. Are you ready to collect all the stars?

[Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) the creator of Advent of Code tweeted this reminder:

I started participating in 2019 and have been hooked ever since. 
I don't need chocolate advent calendars because I have something much better every day in December.
I'm _definitely_ not the best at solving these puzzles, but I have a lot of fun while doing it.

Here are my stars over the years:

So, there are still quite many stars to collect!

One of the things I like about Advent of Code is the community and the discussions around these puzzles.
You can find them and more at [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
There is also help available if you get stuck with the puzzles.

I don't often do visualizations about puzzles, but I did one for day 18 in 2019. I was so happy
when I finally managed to solve the puzzle that I had to create this:

**Go Reddit and see how cool [visualizations](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/?f=flair_name%3A%22Visualization%22)**
**people have created over the years.**

**Or then you can use search in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=advent+of+code+visualisation)**
**to find videos about visualizations.**

I'll put a few examples of illustrations that people have created over the years:
