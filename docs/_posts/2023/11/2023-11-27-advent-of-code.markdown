[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 is starting in just a few days.
25 days of coding puzzles to solve. Are you ready to collect all the stars?

I started participating in 2019 and have been hooked ever since. 
I don't need chocolate calendars because I have something much better to look forward to every day in December.
I'm not the best at solving the puzzles, but I have a lot of fun doing it.

Here are my stars over the years:

One of the things I like about Advent of Code is that people create so fancy illustrations for their solutions.
You can find them and more on [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
There is also good discussions and help available there if you get stuck with some of the puzzles.

I rarely do those illustrations, but I did it for day 18 in 2019. I was so proud of my solution that I had to make a fancy illustration for it:

## Other examples

I'll put few examples of illustrations that people have created over the years:
